# OthelloGPT-mini

Replicating the Othello GPT paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13382) and Neel Nanda's follow up on linear probing (https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/othello), using a 6x6 board to reduce training times.

## Notes

- Focus on some core investigations and simplify aggressively
    - We want to discover robust, scalable mech interp techniques from the way that OthelloGPT learns rules
    - Reducing to 6x6 was a good move: increase iteration speed without reducing complexity too much
    - Shouldn't have tried including pass moves, this complicates too much
    - Still conflicted about using mp for data gen. KISS vs cpus go brrrrrrr.
- (B)log the process as you go!


- Original side goal was it'd be cool to have an LLM that explains itself


## Observations

- Reduce model to 2 layers, 8 heads, 128 dims
    - Train probes on blocks.0.hook_resid_pre (linear_probe_20250203_173005_embed.pt)
        - Knows which move was just played => not empty, mine
        - "Empty" seems to record statistical priors of an outwardly expanding ring, with corners filled last
        - "Mine" performance degrades with seq len, ends up only recording latest move
        - Pos embed seems to have an alternating pattern mod 2. Last layer is really active
    - Train probes on blocks.0.hook_resid_post (linear_probe_20250201_084310.pt)
        - When run on embedded tokens, "legal" and "empty" predict the latest move, and "mine" shows some captures as well as mines!
        - "empty" almost perfect, "mine" degrades over seq len (TODO check acc over #times flipped, also #tiles flipped when flipped)

## Research summary

# probe.py
1. [TODO] Break down %var explained by each probe
2. Plot probe loss/acc vs layer, pos
3. Plot probe predictions
4. Plot cross-orthogonality between probes
5. Plot orthogonality between the same probe across different board squares

# neurons.py
1. Plot top 20 W_in/W_out neurons in a probe basis, sorted by kurtosis, split by probe sign
2. [TODO] Plot W_in/W_out for specific neurons across several probes, to visually inspect modular circuits
3. Plot excess kurtosis for neurons in each layer for each probe

# attention.py
1. Visualise attention patterns
2. [TODO] plot OV/QK matrices relative to probes (similarly to W_in/W_out analysis in neurons.py)

# circuits.py
1. Label neurons according to their significant probe directions

# causal.py
